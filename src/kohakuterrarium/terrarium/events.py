"""Engine event types and filter for ``Terrarium.subscribe()``.

Every observable thing the runtime engine does — a creature emitting
text, a tool firing, a channel message landing, a topology change, a
session getting forked — surfaces as an :class:`EngineEvent`.  WS / log
/ trace consumers translate these to their wire formats; programmatic
consumers can iterate them directly via ``async for ev in t.subscribe()``.
